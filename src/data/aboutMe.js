    introduction:
      "To move from Engineering into tech may seem like an unusual decision, this is how it happened... in summary it is satisfying to solve complex problems. With web development, solutions are instantly rendered on screen providing an instant reward for the work completed.",

      "The Oil industry is an interesting and often exciting place to work, with opportunities to work all over the world (although my children saw to it that I didn't take advantage of that!). Throughout my career, it provided me with a range of different roles and responsibilities and I was fortunate enough to experience a variety of engineering processes in extreme and remote environments.",
      "One of my responsibilities was to manage the project to convert our Client's monthly powerpoint presentation into a dynamic website with live data, available in real time.",
      "I oversaw the construction of the site, speeding up development by enabling on the spot decisions and preventing rewriting code delivering a well presented product that contained all the data our client was hoping for.",
      "The logical and technical challenges faced during the development were at times difficult, but the reward of completing the work was particularly satisfying.",

That said, I have 3 boys that love being outside and keep me young by asking me to join in. I have to thank all 3 though, as due to them I am reliving some of my own childhood...",

      "Mountain biking: This was my all time favourite activity as a teenager, and although I don't get out on my bike as much as I would like, I still enjoy flying down the tracks. All 3 of my boys enjoy it now too, especially if its wet and muddy, deliberately choosing the dirtiest route! Ollie is the oldest and is almost capable of maintining his bike completely, Ben is a steady rider and just gets on with it, while Sam enjoys the hills, providing its not up!",
      "RC Crawlers: Compared the toys that were available when I was a child, these things are incredible. We have a couple of vehicles that we take hillwalking and they are more capable than I am! Ollie has his own that he built himself from a kit, Sam and Ben might get one this year from Santa.",
      "Music: For as long as I can remember, I've loved listening to music and really enjoy my stereo. As much as I can sit down and enjoy watching a blockbuster movie, I can also sit for hours and listen to album after album."
