      "I'm a mechanical engineer turned software developer currently based in Aberdeen, Scotland. I originally studied at the University of Loughborough and recently embarked on a career change to experience something completely different.",

      'Originally from Hull, I moved to Aberdeen several years ago when my former boss asked if I\'d be interesting in moving to the "Oil and Gas Capital". I relocated, bought my first proprty and started a new chapter in my life.',
      "I'm still based in Aberdeen but would consider working in another city anywhere in the country. That said, I'm comfortable working from home. I have prior experience of managing remote teams (offshore) and recent experience working remotely, collaborating with teams in different time zones from around the world.",
      "I have 3 awesome boys that I love spending time with, be it swimming, iceskating, bike rides, skimming stones or even turning the living room into a \"cinema\"!",

      "My experience of Lambda school is a mixed one. It is without doubt the hardest I have ever had to work for a sustained period of time. It was intense, difficult, frustrating and relentless its its endeavour to teach us. I have however made some good friends that I imagine I will remain in contact with.",

    title: "Career",
    introduction:
      "After graduating from University I was fortunate enough to land a job working for Lloyds's Register, a prestigious company to which I remained faithful for nearly 10 years. Once temptation got the better of me, I resigned my position at LR to work for Oceaneering, another prestigious company, were I served for about 7 years.",
    contents: [
      "I started work for LR Integrity Services (Oil and Gas) at BP's main gas terminal in Dimlington, Hull. Forming part of a small team at the BP offices overlooking the process plant, I got my first experience of engineering.",
      "Our team was responsible for the integrity management of the onshore terminal and the 18 or so platforms that fed into it. Most my time was split evenly so the majority of it was spent supporting offshore operations.",
      "Over time, I was given more responsibility and projects of my own to look after, with frequent flights to the installations to carry out the work myself.",
      "Due to BP restructuring, separating the onshore and offshore operations, I was offered the opportunity to relocated to Aberdeen and work at the head office with all the other teams. Why not, so I packed my bags and 4 weeks later I was living over 400 miles away.",
      "A loss of the BP contract later on resulted in a brief secondment to another department in LR where I acted as Independant Competent Person, but found this to be quite a lonely existence and wanted to be part of a team again.",
      "Back in integrity services, I spent some time supporting various teams before finding a home looking after the Triton FPSO, where I saw out the rest of my time with LR",
      "My move to Oceaneering was less eventful. After a brief stint working for a department that was soon closed, I was back working Integrity Services at head office. For 6 years I worked on the EnQuest project looking afer the Kittiwake Oil Platform."

    title: "Why change?",
    introduction:
      "To move from Engineering into tech seems like an unusual decision to my friends and famiy. However, this industry didn't really exist when I was younger, so it was never an option. I enjoy coding and find it rewarding solving problems when the results are rendered on screen, these short term wins were missing from my day job.",
    contents: [
      "The Oil industry can be an interesting and sometimes exciting place to work, with opportunities to work all over the world (although my children saw to it that I didn't take advantage of that!). Throughout my career, it provided me with a range of different roles and responsibilities and I was fortunate enough to experience a variety of engineering processes in remote and extreme environments.",
      "One of my responsibilities was to manage the project to convert our Client's monthly powerpoint presentation into a dynamic website with live data, available in real time.",
      "I oversaw the construction of the site and enjoyed getting involved in writing code. We delivered a well presented product that contained all the data our client was hoping for. I found this particularly rewarding.",
      "The logical and technical challenges faced during development were at times difficult, but this made completing the project even more satisfying.",
      "It was time to adopt new challenges and turn my hand to web-development."

    introduction:
      "Generally I think of myself as a home person. Although I like to socialise and spend time outside, I'm also happy cooking and looking after the house. That said, I have 3 boys that love being outside and keep me young by asking me to join in. I have to thank all 3 though, as due to them I am reliving some of my own childhood...",
    contents: [
      "Mountain biking: This was my all time favourite activity as a teenager, and although I don't get out on my bike as much as I would like, I still enjoy flying down the tracks. All 3 of my boys enjoy it now too, especially if its wet and muddy, deliberately choosing the dirtiest route! Ollie is the oldest and is almost capable of maintining his bike completely, Ben is a steady rider and just gets on with it, while Sam enjoys the hills, providing its not up!",
      "RC Crawlers: Compared the toys that were available when I was a child, these things are incredible. We have a couple of vehicles that we take hillwalking and they are more capable than I am! Ollie has his own that he built himself from a kit, Sam and Ben might get one this year from Santa.",
      "Music: For as long as I can remember, I've loved listening to music and really enjoy my stereo. As much as I can sit down and enjoy watching a blockbuster movie, I can also sit for hours and listen to album after album.",
      "Motorbike: I loved it. Passing my bike test ranks as one of my best moments to date. Out of respect for my parents I did not get a bike while living at home but once I had my own place, a Ducati Monster was all mine. I loved this machine, brilliant fun. However, children came along so the bike went in order to preserve thier father.",
      "Experiences: I have tried skydiving (15 solo jumps), scuba diving and bungee jumping. I've also been shooting (rifle range and shotgun), tried offroad driving, go-karting, archery and in my previous life, I've had flying lessons and done my own loop the loop!"
